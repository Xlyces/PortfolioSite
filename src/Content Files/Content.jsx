//About Me
export const aboutMe='About Me'
export const aboutMeContent='I am a student from the Bachelor of Laws degree in the University of Hong Kong. Although this degree is often considered a Social Science discipline decorated with Language and Literature,  I consider myself an anomaly who also draws strength from a great technological understanding over STEM subjects such as mathematics and programming. A demonstration of this lies before you, in this organically coded website developed from scratch by myself alone. I am also all rounded, in that I pride myself in being able to communicate confidently and efficiently. Now please, explore this website as I present myself before you. '

This was achieved by doing 10 hour days consistently for two months straight.

export const uSkillDescriptionA2='My proficiency in technology extends beyond that of basic understanding. This website was coded in the top-end front-end development language “React” which optimises efficiency and reusability. Most notably, the front-end of Netflix, Instagram, Facebook, were all coded with React. This language is unique in that it is highly efficient and reusable, but notorious for its steep learning curve and complexity in its organisation. \n \n Nonetheless, hopefully this shows that not only am I ready to learn and understand technology or anything for the matter, but once my interest has been piqued I will learn anything and everything I can about said subject.'

Having been a student representative of one of the largest environmental NGOs in Hong Kong, Clean Air Network, I have had the pleasure of serving the community around us by assisting in conducting research and pushing forward policies that enhance Hong Kong’s air quality as a whole. Most notably, the policy I was most involved in was one which successfully pushed the government into replacing outdated fossil-fuel ferries with hybrid ferries, significantly lowering carbon emissions and pollutants.'

export const int3E='An instrument I began playing after complete mastery of the Piano. Absolutely adore jazz and blues due to their unpredictability despite supposedly being confined to a framework.
